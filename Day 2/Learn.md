# 1.Python List
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Lists are used to stored multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are creating using square Brackets.

# List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

1. Allow Dublicates
2. Allow multiple Data type

# List Comprehension
When user want to create new list using existing list in short code.

# List Methods
Python has a set of built-in methods in List like

Method	    Description
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	    Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	    Returns a copy of the list
count()	    Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	    Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	    Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	    Sorts the list


# 2.Python Tuples
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples item
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Tuples is ordered,Unchangeable and Allow Duplicates.

# Change Tuples values
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

# Unpacking a Tuple
When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple.
But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking".

# Using Asterisk*
If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list.

# Tuple Methods

Method	    Description
count()	    Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	    Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
