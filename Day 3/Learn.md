# Python Classes and Object

Python is object oriented programming Language.

# Classes
In Python, Classes is "Blueprint" of object.

# __init__() Function
In real world application we use __init__() function with Classes and Object.
In Python, All classes have function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created.

# __str__()
The __str__() fuction is control what should be return when class object is represent as a string.
If __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned.

# Object Methods
Objects can also contain Methods.
Methods also called function.

# self Parameter
self perameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.
It is user to assess variables of the class.
It's not inportent to name give 'self', you can call it whatever you like, but in first place in Class Parameters.

# pass statment
In Python class defination is can't empty.
But if you want to class defination with no contant, put the pass statment inside the class to avoid error.

# inharitance
Inharitance means it allows to access of all the methods and propertis to another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Polymorphism
Polymorphism means 'many forms'.
In programming , it refer to metods/function/operators with the same namethat can be executed on many object or classes.
