# Identifiers:
1. Seqcquences of letter, digits and underscore
2. Can be any length
3. Starts with only letter(a-z or A-Z)
4. Started with underscore(_)
5. cannot start with digit

# Comments:
use to '#' and ' ''' '

# Type Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with the type casting.

# VAriable Name
Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# Assign Multiple Values
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

# Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

# Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function  are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

# Local Variable
Variables that are created inside of a function are known as local variables.
local variables can be used only within function.

# Globle Keyword
Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

# Operators:
1. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, //, **)
2. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=	)
3. Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
4. Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
5. Identity operators (IS, IS NOT)
6. Membership operators (IN, IN NOT)
7. Bitwise operators ()

# Built-in Data Types
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	    str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:   	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:  	NoneType


# Sequences in Python
1. List 
2. Tuples
3. Set
4. Dictionary
